Quick Command-Line Install
==========================

.. warning::
    
    While the pyPRISM code is now publically available, the developers are
    still working on integrating the code into other systems (PyPI, Conda-Forge,
    Binder). The methods of install described below will not work until the
    PyPI or Conda-Forge integrations are complete. In the interim, see
    :ref:`manual_cui_install` for instructions on how to install pyPRISM
    manually. We thank you for your patience as we work on these features.  

Install pyPRISM with all basic dependences via conda or pip from the command
line. These commands should be platform agnostic and work for Unix, OSX, and
Windows *if* you have `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__ or `pip
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__ installed. 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge pyPRISM

or

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyPRISM
