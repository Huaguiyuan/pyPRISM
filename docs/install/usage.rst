Using pyPRISM
=============

Before ``pyPRISM`` can be used two primary setup tasks must occur

- All dependencies must be satistifed. See :ref:`dependencies`.
- pyPRISM must be placed on your ``PYTHONPATH`` either manually or via installation

Once these tasks are satisfied, ``pyPRISM`` can be imported and used in scripts
or notebooks. The tutorial notebooks are in the *tutorial* directory in the
codebase `repository <https://github.com/usnistgov/pyprism/>`__.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <pyPRISM tutorial directory>

    $ jupyter notebook

This should spawn a jupyter notebook tab in your web browser of choice. If the
tab doesn't spawn, check the terminal for a link that can be copied and pasted.
See :ref:`tutorial` for more information.
