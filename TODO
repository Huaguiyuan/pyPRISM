    FAQs
        - What do I do if the solver isn't converging?
            - Vary your domain spacing and domain size
            - Change your closures
            - Consider your location in phase-space
                maybe the equations aren't converging because you aren't within the
                simple isotropic liquid region of your system. Vary the interactions,
                density, etc
                phase separation low-K
            - Give the solver a better initial guess
                This can often be achieved by finding a convergable system that is 
                'nearby' in phase space and then using the solution of that problem
                i.e. PRISM.x as the 'guess' to a new PRISM solution.
            - (advanced) Perhaps try a different numerical solver or solution scheme
        - What do I do if The solver seems "stuck" i.e. the funk norm isn't decreasing?
        - How do I set up system X?
            - Please make sure you have looked at ALL provided examples and at least
              skimmed the documentation. We have attempted to provide a number of 
              different examples and use-cases.
        - What doesn't typyPRISM doesn't have feature X?
            - Because you haven't added it yet! 
                - Please see the How tos if X is a potential, closure, or intra-molecular correlation 
                  function. These are quite trivi
              is something other than that, please consider a
            - IMPORTANT: If you add something awesome to typyPRISM, create a pull
              request and share this with the community!
