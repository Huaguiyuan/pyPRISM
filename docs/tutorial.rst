pyPRISM Tutorial
================

A companion tutorial to the documentation can be found in the source of the
pyPRISM package. This tutorial can be used interactively in live Jupyter
notebooks or rendered as a static document. The benefit of using a live Jupyter
notebook is that users are able to edit and run real pyPRISM code while the
static website provides a rapid, and setup-free way to survey the codebase. The
static version of this tutorial is collected below for convenience. 

On top of teaching users how to use pyPRISM, the tutorial covers the basics of
Python, Jupyter notebooks, and PRISM theory. These non-codebase related topics
are not covered in detail in this documentation. The tutorial also goes over
several case studies from the literature and illustrates how pyPRISM can be
used to reproduce results from these studies.
