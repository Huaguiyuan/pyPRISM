Using pyPRISM
=============

Once pyPRISM is installed or placed in your ``PYTHONPATH`` it can be imported
and used in scripts. To use the examples in the associated pyPRISM tutorial
directory (downloaded separately at the
`pyPRISM_tutorial <https://github.com/usnistgov/pyPRISM_tutorial>`_ repository)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <pyPRISM tutorial directory>

    $ jupyter notebook

This should spawn a jupyter notebook tab in your web browser of choice. If the
tab doesn't spawn, check the terminal for a link that can be copied and pasted.
