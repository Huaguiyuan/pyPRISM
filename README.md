Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model (PRISM) theory describes the
equilibrium spatial-correlations of liquid-like polymer systems including
melts, blends, solutions, block copolymers, ionomers, liquid crystal forming
polymers and nanocomposites. Using PRISM theory, one can calculate
thermodynamic (second virial coefficients, Flory-Huggins Ï‡ interaction
parameters, potentials of mean force) and structural (pair correlation
functions, structure factors) information for these macromolecular materials.
PyPRISM is a Python-based, open-source framework for conducting
PRISM theory calculations. This framework aims to simplify PRISM-based studies
by providing a user-friendly scripting interface for setting up and numerically
solving the PRISM equations. pyPRISM also provides data structures, functions,
and classes that streamline PRISM calculations, allowing pyPRISM to be extended
for use in other tasks such as the coarse-graining of atomistic simulation
force-fields or the modeling of experimental scattering data. The goal of
providing this framework is to reduce the barrier to correctly and
appropriately using PRISM theory and to provide a platform for rapid
calculations of the structure and thermodynamics of polymeric fluids and
nanocomposites.

Example
=======
Below is an example python script where we use pyPRISM to calculate the pair
correlation functions for a nanocomposite (polymer + particle) system with
attractive polymer-particle interactions. Below the script is a plot of the
pair correlation functions from this calculation.

```python
import pyPRISM
from pyPRISM.calculate.pair_correlation import pair_correlation

sys = pyPRISM.System(['particle','polymer'],kT=1.0)
sys.domain = pyPRISM.Domain(dr=0.01,length=4096)
    
sys.density['polymer']  = 0.75
sys.density['particle'] = 6e-6

sys.diameter['polymer']  = 1.0
sys.diameter['particle'] = 5.0

sys.omega['polymer','polymer']   = pyPRISM.omega.FreelyJointedChain(length=100,l=4.0/3.0)
sys.omega['polymer','particle']  = pyPRISM.omega.InterMolecular()
sys.omega['particle','particle'] = pyPRISM.omega.SingleSite()

sys.potential['polymer','polymer']   = pyPRISM.potential.HardSphere(sigma=1.0)
sys.potential['polymer','particle']  = pyPRISM.potential.Exponential(sigma=3.0,alpha=0.5,epsilon=1.0)
sys.potential['particle','particle'] = pyPRISM.potential.HardSphere(sigma=5.0)

sys.closure['polymer','polymer']   = pyPRISM.closure.PercusYevick()
sys.closure['polymer','particle']  = pyPRISM.closure.PercusYevick()
sys.closure['particle','particle'] = pyPRISM.closure.HyperNettedChain()

PRISM = sys.createPRISM()

PRISM.solve()

pcf = pyPRISM.calculate.prism.pair_correlation(PRISM)
```

Tutorial
========

- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/usnistgov/pyPRISM_tutorial) 
- [Static Website](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/usnistgov/pyPRISM_tutorial/blob/master/NB0.Introduction.ipynb)

A companion tutorial to the documentation can be found on GitHub.  This
tutorial can be used interactively in a live Jupyter notebook or rendered as a
static webpage using the nbviewer feature on the Jupyter website. The benefit
of using a live Jupyter notebook is that users are able to edit and run real
pyPRISM code while the static website provides a rapid and setup-free way to
survey the codebase.  

The tutorial not only teaches users how to use pyPRISM, but also covers the
basics PRISM theory, provide a basic introduction to Python, Jupyter, and some
related theoretical concepts. These non-codebase related topics are not covered
in detail in the documentation. The tutorial also goes over several case
studies from the literature and how pyPRISM can be used to reproduce data from
these studies. 

Documentation
=============

- [ReadTheDocs.io](https://pyPRISM.readthedocs.io/).

Quick Install
=============
The commands below shoul install pyPRISM with all basic dependences via conda
or pip. These commands should be platform agnostic and work for Unix, OSX, and
Windows *if* you have Anaconda or pip correctly installed.  For full
installation instructions please see the documentation. 

``` bash
$ conda install pyPRISM
```

or

``` bash
$ pip install pyPRISM
```
