How to contribute to pyPRISM?
-----------------------------

The ultimate goal of pyPRISM is to create a community of researchers who build upon each others efforts in developing PRISM-based techniques and applying these techniques to cutting edge problems. In order to make this possible, we need outside contributions to the codebase. The source code and all development for pyPRISM will be handled through the `repository <https://github.com/usnistgov/pyPRISM.git>`_ on GitHub. The primary route for adding a new module or feature to pyPRISM is through the common "fork + pull request" paradigm that is used across Github. See `here <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ for a description on how to carry out this process.  While this method is common in the open-source community, we recognize that this may be over-complicated for some PRISM researchers. Please file an `Issue <https://github.com/usnistgov/pyPRISM/issues>`_ or contact the developers directly if you have a contribution but don't wish to use git/GitHub to integrate it.

How to file a bug report, suggest a feature or ask a question about pyPRISM?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As is suggested above, GitHub uses an `Issue <https://github.com/usnistgov/pyPRISM/issues>`_ system to track communication between users and developers. This system has a flexible tagging feature which allows the system to handle multiple types of posts. Users should post bug reports, feature requests, or questions to the issue system and the developers (or other users!) will respond as soon as they can.
