Tutorial
========

A companion tutorial to the documentation can be found in the source of the
pyPRISM package. This tutorial can be used interactively in live Jupyter
notebooks or rendered as a static document. The benefit of using a live Jupyter
notebook is that users are able to edit and run real pyPRISM code while the
static website provides a rapid, and setup-free way to survey the codebase.  On
top of teaching users how to use pyPRISM, the tutorial covers the basics of
Jupyter notebooks, Python, and PRISM theory.The tutorial also goes over several
case studies from the literature and illustrates how pyPRISM can be used to
reproduce results from these studies.
